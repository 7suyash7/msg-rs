# `msg-rs`
> A flexible and lightweight messaging library for distributed systems built with Rust and Tokio.

## Overview
`msg-rs` is a messaging library that was inspired by projects like [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) and [Nanomsg](https://nanomsg.org/).
It was built because we needed a Rust-native messaging library like those above.
