# Getting started with MSG-RS

To add MSG-RS to your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
msg = { git = "https://github.com/chainbound/msg-rs" }
```

**Warning: MSG-RS is currently in ALPHA, and is not yet recommended for use in production.**

We plan to release MSG-RS to [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) once it reaches a beta stage.
Until then, we recommend using the git dependency as shown above.
